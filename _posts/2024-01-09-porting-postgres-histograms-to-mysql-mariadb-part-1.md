A more accurate title wouldâ€™ve been porting Postgresâ€™ conditional selectivity to MySQL, but youâ€™d ask me whatâ€™s conditional selectivity then! This blog post series will explain both.

# Introduction

I have been hacking around since last week in MySQL/MariaDB hack week (organization courtesy â€” [Phil!](https://eatonphil.com/)) with ~80 odd brilliant hackers. Going into the hack week, my goal was to figure out how a SELECT query works in MariaDB and how its Query Execution Planner(QEP) internally works.

> The rough notes that I took through the week around QEP notes can be found here in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/uds5501/fbb2f96c24f24c21500926e5ffb35b91). If you already know about selectivity concept in databases thoroughly, you can skip to part 2, to the actual implementation.


During my QEP code read, I realized that all the plans are built around pre-calculated statistics for Tables, Indexes, and Columns (in MySQL). These plans may sometimes utilize histograms to determine the selectivity of rows on un-indexed columns, while I canâ€™t change the QEP algorithm in a week, I sure as hell can implement some data structures! But before we get there in the implementation details, letâ€™s address the elephant in the room.

# Whatâ€™s Selectivity?

Imagine you have the following table
```sql
CREATE TABLE sample_table (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  i INT NOT NULL,
  d DOUBLE NOT NULL);

CREATE_TABLE sample_inner_table {
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  i INT NOT NULL,
}

CREATE INDEX sample_table_d on sample_table(d);

// Imagine sample_table &amp;sample_inner_table has 20,000,000 rows.
```


Now, imagine you run the following query

```sql
SELECT sample_table.id,sample_inner_table.id AS inner_id
FROM sample_table
JOIN sample_inner_table ON sample_table.i = sample_inner_table.i
WHERE sample_table.d > 10.0
  AND sample_inner_table.id > 5
  AND sample_table.i = 3;
```

Your databaseâ€™s query planner will try and estimate the following query plans (among other plans)

To estimate the IO Cost and the number of rows itâ€™ll need to pass on to the join in Select predicates, i.e, *Ïƒ(id>5)* and *Ïƒ(i=3 AND d>),* your database can either use indexes (which itâ€™ll most probably use for *Ïƒ(d>10)* ) or it will use existing histograms / similar data structures to determine how many rows I want to send to the next step, this ratio is called **selectivity** .

Rows sent to the next stage would be $selectivity * totalrows$

# How does MariaDB/MySQL do it?

As of [MariaDB 11.4](https://github.com/MariaDB/server), there are 3 histogram implementations, two of them are height-balanced (**SINGLE_PREC_HB**  and **DOUBLE_PREC_HB** ) and by default, they use somewhat new **JSON_HB (** I have a hunch this is already similar to postgres, based on the values but I havenâ€™t checked itâ€™s implementation :) )

> Fun Fact: JSON_HB was introduced as a Google Summer of Code Project, as per this [JIRA](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-28113).

I will currently take the example of **SINGLE_PREC_HB** and explain how histogram building works in its context.

Imagine the total rows in the table to be **R** , and the histogram width to be **w,** so each bucket in the histogram would take **R/w**  records. In the bucket, however, youâ€™ll be storing the relative position of the current element where the relative position is determined by `(current_element-min_element)/(max_element-min_element)`  in the column.

The image below should make more sense ðŸ˜„
![Medium-Image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*jT42VvALhNLqtEMNPr0t7w.png)

You can find the algorithm of histogram building below but as an overview, if the current cumulative row count &gt; bucket * capacity, then Iâ€™ll set the interval position in this bucket otherwise Iâ€™ll proceed to the next distinct element.

Ex: The cumulative count while processing Element 9 would be 6 + 10 + 3 (16).

    domain="github.com"
%}

Now, when you are running the query:
```sql
SELECT * FROM sample_table WHERE v >= 2 and v <= 14; 
```

Itâ€™ll convert 2 and 14 to respective estimated positions (here, theyâ€™ll be `0.00`  and `0.6875`  respectively). Now, youâ€™ll try and find the buckets where these values can lie. So, your min bucket index will be 1, and the max bucket index will be 7. Hence **the planner can send you rows stored in an estimated 7 buckets!**

Since you have a total 10 buckets, the ***selectivity***  becomes `7/10`  or `0.700`  and the QEP will be returning an estimated `0.700*25`  = **18 rows.**

This way of estimating selectivity is called [*range_selectivity*](https://github.com/MariaDB/server/blob/11.4/sql/sql_select.cc#L1044) !

# Sweet! But how does postgres do it?

Postgres handles different kinds of data types differently, but to keep this discussion simple, weâ€™ll stick with integers. To read the implementation detail better, Iâ€™d suggest reading this [row estimation algorithm](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/row-estimation-examples.html).

Unlike MySQL, postgres distributes its buckets to hold different value bounds.
![Medium-Image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*wLHcMBgfE6QvacHpFppCDg.png)

If you notice here, we donâ€™t talk about the frequencies of the element appearing ðŸ¤”. We just assume that all the buckets have equal chance of appearing (as MySQL does) and selectivity of an element in a bucket is determined by $(element - \text{min\_bound}) / (\text{max\_bound}-\text{min\_bound})$  , sounds familiar no? ðŸ˜‰

That being said, letâ€™s estimate what happens when we run the query:
```
SELECT * FROM sample_table WHERE v >= 2 and v<=14;
```

As we can see, `v>=2 and v<= 14` means buckets 1â€“7 will be completely included in this range and bucket 8 will be partially included.

So, the selectivity shall be $(7+(0/2))/10 = 0.700$

Funny how the selectivity turns out to be the exact same in both histogram layouts no? ðŸš€

# Conclusion

I hope you now understand **selectivity** ! Iâ€™ll request you to go and play around with this concept first before we move on to the porting implementation details in the [next blog post](/2024/01/09/porting-postgres-histograms-to-mysql-mariadb-part-2.html).
