Hey, thanks for stopping by!

I am Uddeshya Singh, Senior Software Engineer in RnD team at [Imply Data](https://imply.io/), primarily working on improving OSS Druid. You can find my work done so far here - [Uddeshya's commits](https://github.com/apache/druid/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Auds5501+is%3Aclosed).

My interests varies between distributed systems, systems engineering and algorithms in geek side. I write about those rabbit-hole explorations here. You can find my older writings at my [medium page](https://medium.com/@singhuddeshyaofficial).

Outside of work, I am a football fan and up for a good walk/run in the park.

Have a good one üçª and Glory Glory Man United!
