Hey, thanks for stopping by!

I am Uddeshya Singh, Senior Software Engineer at [Gojek](https://gojek.com). In my 9-5, I work on building and maintaining resilient distributed systems to handle payments traffic at citizen scale. 

In my 5-9, my interests varies between distributed systems, systems engineering and algorithms in geek side. I write about those rabbit-hole explorations here. You can find my older writings at my [medium page](https://medium.com/@singhuddeshyaofficial).

Outside of work, I am a football fan and up for a good walk/run in the park.

Have a good one üçª and Glory Glory Man United!
